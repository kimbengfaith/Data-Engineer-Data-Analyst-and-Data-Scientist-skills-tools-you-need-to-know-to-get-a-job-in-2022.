Considering the data workflow (from collection to prediction), dealing with data is so broad that it cannot be generalized to a single role or job. To make it easier to process, explore, and exploit, it is divided into various job categories.

In general, there are four types of jobs in data.
* **Data Engineer** 
* **Data Analyst**
* **Data Scientist**
* **Machine Learning Engineer/Scientist**

As you progress, youâ€™ll notice that these job categories are subdivided into subcategories such as **business analyst**, **data architect**, **chief data officer**, and so on.

This article will walk you through the workflows and tools that every data engineer, data analyst, and data scientist should be familiar with.

## Data Engineers

Data Engineers are primarily concerned with **data collection** and **storage**.

Data engineers manage the workflow by collecting and converting raw data into information that data analysts/scientists can use. They design data pipelines and storage systems.
They Create infrastructure that makes data not only easier to collect but also easier to obtain and process.

### Tools:

* **SQL**: SQL is required for data storage and organization.
* To process data, every data engineer must be familiar with at least one of these programming languages: **Java, Scalar, or Python**.
* **Shell:** They need the shell command line in order to automate and run tasks (install Linux ubuntu for this or any other Linux operating system).
* They must be familiar with **AWS**, **Azure**, **Google Cloud**, or any other cloud computing platform in order to accept and store large amounts of data.

## Data Analyst

The focus of a data analyst is on **data preparation**, **exploration**, and **visualization**.

Data analysts conduct simpler analyses that describe data. In order to accomplish this, they must exploit the data and create reports and dashboards to summarize data.
Typically, they must first clean the data before creating reports and dashboards. Data analysts have fewer programming skills.

### Tools:

* **SQL** is required to retrieve and collect data that the data engineer has already processed and stored.
* Spreadsheets like **Excel or Google Sheets** can be used to perform simple analyses on small amounts of data.
* BI tools like Power BI, Looker, and Tableau to create dashboards and visualization.
* **Python or R programming:** for data cleaning and analysis.

## Data Scientist

Data scientists are concerned with **data preparation**, **exploration**, **visualization**, **experimentation**, and **prediction**.

They have a strong background in statistics, which allows them to discover new insights from data rather than simply describe it.
They use traditional machine learning for prediction and forecasting.

### Tools:

* **SQL** tools are required to retrieve and collect previously processed and stored data by the data engineer.
* Libraries such as **pandas for Python** or **tidyverse for R programming** are used to manipulate data.
* To explore and visualize data, they use libraries such as **Matplotlib and seaborn**.
* Machine learning libraries like **TensorFlow and Spark** make predictions based on visualized data.
